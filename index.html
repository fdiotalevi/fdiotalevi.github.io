	I don't remember where I got the suggestion to read this book; it must be something related to my quest to find books that talks about the foundations of technology, rather than about the latest and greatest tool. Anyway, somewhere I found a link to this nice little book, and I'm glad I did.</p>

	You can think about <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0735611319/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0735611319&linkCode=as2&tag=diotalevicom-21">Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=diotalevicom-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0735611319" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> as an Introduction to Electronic university course, given by a professor that actually cares about his students. Weird, I know.
	</p>
	<!--more-->
	<p>
	The book is actually much more than that. Its trajectory goes through two thousands years of discovers, starting from the concept of numbers to Object Oriented Programming; explaining, in the process, binary numbers, relays, logic gates, transistors, integrated circuits, Intel 8080 and Motorola 6800, assembly language and operating systems. Everything is plain and simple English, with a surprising attention to details.
	</p>
	<p>
	The book is so simple, and convincing, you'll actually consider (for a short while) building your own adding machine, or going back to Assembly to code your next toy project. It is seriously that good!</p>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p>I see only a couple of shortcomings in this book: the first, is that it feels, and is, a book written in the twentieth century. So many things happened in the past twelve years which are not reflected in here. Second, it's mainly a hardware book; it talks, in the last few chapters, about programming languages and operating system, but it's only a very brief overview.</p>
	<p>
	So now, after enjoying Charles Petzold's Code, the question is: is there an equally good book about the story of operating systems or programming languages? For any suggestion, please <a href="https://twitter.com/fdiotalevi">give me a shout on Twitter</a>.

	<p>
	A few useful (mostly for myself) notes after <a href='http://strataconf.com/strataeu/'>Strata London 2012</a>.<br/>
	As other people there noticed, quite a disappointing conference. Not just for the appalling location (note for organizers: hosting conferences in hotels is almost always a bad idea), but because all the topics of the conference felt, at least, three years old. Some of the things missing:
	<ul>
	<li>Graph databases, not a single mention</li>
	<li>Real time analytics and machine learning: too little. Three related talks, no mentions to Storm and alternatives</li>
	<li>No talks on R and related technologies?</li>
	<li>Very little on data visualization (mostly driven by The Guardian and Tableau)</li>
	</ul>
	On the other side, too much of...
	<ul>
	<li>Hadoop everywhere! I do understand many of the sponsors were Hadoop "resellers", but so many talks?</li>
	<li>Non technical talks.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	Rant<br/>
	I don't really know who started this trend of having non-technical, "cultural", "i will surprise you with my precious insights" kind of talks at technical conferences. I admit that at times it may be fun, even interesting, like when Bob Martin goes into details explaining how black holes work. However, isn't it boring when you see that happening at every single conference?<br/>
	Do we really need three talks talking about Turing, Babbage and co, and what Big Data was like 50 years ago?
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	After the moanings, a list of the few discoveries that are worth a second look
	<!--more-->
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Open Data and Open Government in UK</b><br><br>
	UK seems to be quite serious about opening up their data. Some examples:<br/>
	<a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/">Legislation.gov.uk</a> offers the UK legislation, accessible via API and open to 3rd party applications<br>
	<a href="http://www.theodi.org/">The Open Data Institute</a> is the place to start to learn about the government Open Data policy
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Pro Bono IT and Big Data</b><br><br>
	I have been looking for years (since I learnt about the inspiring <a href="http://java.net/projects/jug-avis">JugAvis</a> project) to find opportunities to connect charities and NGO with developers wanting to work pro-bono. Now <a href="http://datakind.org/">DataKind</a> proposes to do that. "Using data in the service of humanity" is their tagline. It's a US no-profit, but hopefully they'll expand their activities to UK soon. 
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>I learnt that Google is producing tools for data analysis quicker than I can learn about</b><br><br>
	In no particular order
	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/">Google Refine</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.google.com/fusiontables/Home/">Google Fusion Tables<a></li>
	<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/bigquery/">Google BigQuery</a></li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>There's quite a lot of research going on around online (streaming) algorithms</b><br><br>
	... and it's not only limited to "summarizing" algorithms, but also to online machine learning.<br/>
	<a href="https://github.com/clearspring/stream-lib">Stream Lib</a> implements some of them<br/>

   <h2 class="entry-title">London Population Over the Years</h2>
   
   <div class="info">Published by <span class="author vcard"><span class="fn">Filippo Diotalevi</span></span>
      on <span class="published" datetime="2012-08-06 12:00:00">6th August 2012</span> 
      (last update <span class="updated" datetime="2012-08-06 12:00:00">6th August 2012</span>)
   </div>

	<p>
	  After a few weeks of intense work sharpening my <a href='http://www.r-project.org/'>R</a> skills, I figured it was about time to start pushing out some code. One of my favourite blog is the awesome <a href='http://spatialanalysis.co.uk/'>Spatial Analysis</a>, so why not starting with some maps?
	<img src="http://blog.diotalevi.com.s3.amazonaws.com/londonpop/year-1801.png" width="700">  
	</p>
	<p>
	The maps displayed in this blog post are the combination of two distinct datasets:
	<ul>
	<li>The UK "Boundary Line" dataset, downloadable (after a tricky and tedious procedure) from <a href='https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/opendatadownload/products.html'>this website</a></li>
	<li>The Historic Census dataset downloadable from the <a href='http://data.london.gov.uk/datastore/package/historic-census-population'>London Datastore</a> website</li>
	</ul>
	<!--more-->
	<p>
	The first dataset (Boundary Line) contains the polygons (<i>shapelines</i>) defining British counties, districts, cities, ... I used <a href='http://ggplot2.org/'>ggplot2</a> to display the shapelines (mostly because I wanted to learnt it better). <br>
	The second dataset contains the population in each London borough from 1801 to 2001. Merging the two dataset is immediate. <a href='https://github.com/fdiotalevi/london-population'>The full code is on Github</a>, and 36 lines of codes are all you need to load, merge and display the data.
	</p>
	<p> 
	The different images show, as expected, how the population has progressively increased in number, and moved away from the central boroughs (Westminster, City of London in particular).
	<br>
	  <img src="http://blog.diotalevi.com.s3.amazonaws.com/londonpop/year-1851.png" width="700">
	  <img src="http://blog.diotalevi.com.s3.amazonaws.com/londonpop/year-1901.png" width="700">
	  <img src="http://blog.diotalevi.com.s3.amazonaws.com/londonpop/year-1931.png" width="700">
	<br>  
	  After the second world war, there's the most noticeable increase in population of the external boroughs; Barnet, Croydon, Ealing are rapidly moving from average-low inhabited boroughs to some of the most populated; all the other external boroughs show similar increases.
	  
	  <img src="http://blog.diotalevi.com.s3.amazonaws.com/londonpop/year-1971.png" width="700">
	  <br>  
	  The last 30 years of the 20th century don't show a significant change in how the population is distributed.
	  <img src="http://blog.diotalevi.com.s3.amazonaws.com/londonpop/year-2001.png" width="700">
	</p>
	<p>
	From a visualization point of view, working with R allows to create maps easily, and with a few lines of code. There are definitely a few things I'd like to improve, like the <i>legend</i> (which sometimes shows numbers in scientific notation, sometimes not, without an apparent reason), and the placement of borough names which sometimes make them difficult to read.<br/>
	Unfortunately the general lack of documentation on R and its packages makes this fine-tuning procedure very hard and time consuming, but it has been surprisingly easy and quick to obtain some decent maps.
