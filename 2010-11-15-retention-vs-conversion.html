	<p>Talking to early-startup founders (just a few days ago at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/the-london-lean-startup-group/">Lean Startup meeting in London</a>) it often strikes me how much attention is paid to user acquisition and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_rate">conversion</a> in particular. Of course everybody loves to be able to talk about their millions of signed up users, but products are evaluated on <strong>active users</strong>, not on signups. Having many active users means your product is useful, while having signups means you are good at marketing and advertising.</p>
	<p>And active users are first and foremost a consequence of <strong>retention.</strong> As <a href="http://500hats.typepad.com/500blogs/">Dave McClure</a> says, your first goal is to build a <strong>better mousetrap</strong>.</p>
	<p><img title="mousetrap_free_505530_43951659.jpg" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1964762/diotalevi.com/images/mousetrap.jpg" border="0" alt="mousetrap_free_505530_43951659.jpg" width="370" height="220" /></p>
	<p>The math is simple: <!--more-->you can spend as much money to make your website perfect, your marketing message crystal clear, but at the end of the day if your users leave the product after a week (that is, you have <strong>low retention</strong>), you don't have a business. You can spend more money, advertise like crazy, but all new users will eventually leave because your product doesn't fit their needs (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070701074943/http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/the-pmarca-gu-2.html">you don't have product/market fit</a>).</p>
	<p>So early stage startups must focus on retention, rather than conversion. Steve Ellis takes a similar approach defining the <a href="http://startup-marketing.com/the-startup-pyramid/">product/market fit as the moment when 40% of the users say they would be very disappointed without your product</a>.</p>
	<p>So the first thing to do is<strong> focus uniquely on your retention until you reach a 40-60% retention</strong> (month over month, week over week, it depends on your product/business); that involves refining your product, adding/removing features, clarifying the user experience, and is the only way to know you have created a product useful for your customers. After that, you can work on conversion, and that's a pure marketing effort.</p>
